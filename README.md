# MECS4510_Evolutionary-Algorithm
# This repository consists of three projects demonstrating the implementation of Evolutionary Algorithm(EA), Genetic Programming(GP), and other classical algorithm like Random Search(RS) and Random Mutation Hill Climber(RMHC).
# Traveling Salesman: The task is to find the shorest path connecting 1000 unique points and returning to the origin. RS, RMHC, and EA are implemented.
